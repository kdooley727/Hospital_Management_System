# Hospital_Management_System
I developed the Hospital_Management_System as a comprehensive desktop application in C# and .NET, designed to streamline and digitize core hospital operations. The solution is structured into modular components, each focusing on a critical aspect of hospital management, including user authentication, patient management, appointment scheduling, medical inventory, and data analytics. The application features a Windows Forms GUI for a user-friendly experience and leverages technologies like MongoDB for data persistence and SignalR for real-time communication.

Key Features:

Secure user authentication and role management (see the "1.1 User Auth" module and Login forms).
Patient information management and tracking (2.2 Patient Man).
Appointment scheduling for patients and staff (3.3 Appointment Scheduling).
Medical inventory management (4.1 Medical Inventory Manager).
Data analytics and reporting to support hospital administration (5.1 Data Analytics).
Real-time chat and communication using SignalR (ChatForm.cs, ChatHub.cs).
Modular solution with separate folders and projects for each major feature, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
Configuration management via appsettings.json and environment files.
MongoDB integration for persistent, scalable data storage.
Technologies & Skills:

Language & Framework: C#, .NET Framework, Windows Forms
Database: MongoDB
Real-Time Communication: SignalR (for chat and notifications)
Skills Demonstrated:
Full-stack desktop application development
Object-oriented programming and modular architecture
GUI design and event-driven programming
Third-party service integration (MongoDB, SignalR)
Application configuration and environment management
Building for scalability and maintainability
My Role: I designed and implemented the entire solution, from architecture and database integration to designing the user interface and implementing critical business logic. I focused on creating a flexible, modular structure to allow for future enhancements and easy maintenance.

Impact: This project demonstrates my ability to deliver robust, enterprise-level software for healthcare operations, incorporating security, scalability, and usability best practices.
